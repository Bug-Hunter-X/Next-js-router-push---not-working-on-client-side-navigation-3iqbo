# Next.js router.push() Client-Side Navigation Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `router.push()` method in Next.js for client-side navigation.  The problem arises when the navigation doesn't work as expected in certain circumstances, specifically on the client-side.

## Bug Description:

The `router.push()` function, when called within a client-side component, may fail to trigger a navigation. This can occur due to issues like improper usage within event handlers or timing conflicts with other operations. 

## Solution:

The solution involves ensuring the `router.push()` call is properly handled within the component lifecycle. This often means using an effect hook to manage navigation based on state changes. You can also debug the issue by inspecting the console to see if any errors are thrown.
